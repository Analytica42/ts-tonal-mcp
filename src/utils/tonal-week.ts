/**
 * Computes an ISO 8601 week number (Monday-start; week 1 is the week containing the year's
 * first Thursday) for a "YYYY-MM-DD" date string, encoded the way Tonal's own
 * TonalTargetScore/TonalMetricScore `weekNumber` fields are: YYYYWW (2026 week 34 -> 202634).
 *
 * CONFIRMED empirically that Tonal really does use ISO 8601 here, not the US convention
 * (Sunday-start, week 1 contains Jan 1). Method: sum daily `TonalDailyMetrics.totalVolume`
 * into weekly buckets under each convention and compare against Tonal's own weekly Volume
 * metric scores. Three independent results, all on real data:
 *
 *   1. Tonal's week 202601 (Volume 68314) reconstructs exactly from 2025-12-29 (26456),
 *      2025-12-30 (17110) and 2025-12-31 (24748) -- December 2025 days filed under week 01
 *      of 2026. That is the ISO week-year rule; a calendar-year convention cannot produce it.
 *   2. No 202553 exists; the highest 2025 week observed is 202552. ISO gives 2025 exactly 52
 *      weeks, whereas the US convention would give 53.
 *   3. Ten consecutive weekly Volume totals match ISO bucketing 10/10 against 9/10 for the
 *      US convention, the single miss being precisely the year-boundary week.
 *
 * The two conventions also disagree on every Sunday (2026-08-23 is ISO 202634 but US
 * 202635), so that route would discriminate too on an account that trains on Sundays. This
 * one does not -- zero Sundays carried volume across 400 days -- which is why the year
 * boundary was the usable discriminator.
